## Current Phase: 10/10 Quality Sprint (post-adversarial review)

### 10/10 Sprint Beads
| Bead | Category | Task | Status |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Q.1 | Security | Replace curl with reqwest for HTTP | DEFERRED (body via stdin is sufficient for now) |
| Q.2 | Code Quality | Deduplicate frontmatter parsing → shared functions in markdown.rs | DONE |
| Q.3 | Code Quality | Make `cmd_list` delegate to `search("")` | DONE |
| Q.4 | Code Quality | Add `///` doc comments to all pub functions | DEFERRED (nice-to-have) |
| Q.5 | Tests | Concurrent PID race test | DEFERRED (needs flock, tracked in PLAN.md) |
| Q.6 | Tests | Fix logging tests to actually test I/O | DONE |
| Q.7 | Production | Call `rotate_logs()` at startup | DONE |
| Q.8 | Production | Make Ollama URL + model configurable | DONE |
| Q.9 | UX | Consistent `-t` flag naming | Already consistent |
| Q.10 | UX | `minutes devices` output to stdout | DONE |

- P1b.5: Calendar integration (ical file parsing)
- P3.2-3: Calendar polling + meeting suggestion notifications
- P3.6: Auto-start on login (plist exists, needs `minutes install-watcher` CLI command)
- P3.7: First-run onboarding wizard
- P3.8: Homebrew cask formula
- P2.7: MCPB packaging (needs spec research)
- Phase 4: Cowork/Dispatch integration
- P4a.3: Structured intent extraction (decisions/actions as queryable YAML frontmatter + MCP filter)

- Phase 4: Cross-meeting intelligence (remaining P4a tasks)
- Real tray icon (not placeholder)
- Apple Shortcut (.shortcut file for iPhone voice memos)

## Resume Instructions (for post-compaction)
1. Read this file to see current status
2. Read PLAN.md for full architecture and task details
3. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
4. `cargo build` to verify everything compiles
5. `cargo test -p minutes-core --no-default-features` for fast tests
6. Continue from the "Remaining" list above
