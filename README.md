**Your AI remembers every conversation you've had.** &nbsp; [useminutes.app](https://useminutes.app)

Agents have run logs. Humans have conversations. **minutes** captures the human side — the decisions, the intent, the context that agents need but can't observe — and makes it queryable.

Record a meeting. Capture a voice memo on a walk. Ask Claude what was decided three weeks ago. It just works.

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS — Desktop app (menu bar, recording UI, AI assistant)
brew install --cask silverstein/tap/minutes

# macOS — CLI only
brew tap silverstein/tap && brew install minutes

# Any platform — from source (requires Rust + cmake)
cargo install minutes-cli

# MCP server only — no Rust needed (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
npx minutes-mcp
```

```bash
minutes setup --model tiny    # Download whisper model (75MB)
minutes record                # Start recording
minutes stop                  # Stop and transcribe
```

## How it works

```
Audio → Transcribe → Summarize → Detect Attendees → Structured Markdown
         (local)       (LLM)      (calendar +          (decisions,
        whisper.cpp   Claude/      transcript)          action items,
                      Ollama/                           people, entities)
                      OpenAI
```

Everything runs locally. Your audio never leaves your machine (unless you opt into cloud LLM summarization). Attendees are automatically detected from macOS Calendar events and participant extraction from the transcript.

## Features

### Record meetings
```bash
minutes record                                    # Record from mic
minutes record --title "Standup" --context "Sprint 4 blockers"  # With context
minutes stop                                      # Stop from another terminal
```

### Take notes during meetings
```bash
minutes note "Alex wants monthly billing not annual billing"          # Timestamped, feeds into summary
minutes note "Logan agreed"                       # LLM weights your notes heavily
```

### Process voice memos
```bash
minutes process ~/Downloads/voice-memo.m4a        # Any audio format
minutes watch                                     # Auto-process new files in inbox
```

### Search everything
```bash
minutes search "pricing"                          # Full-text search
minutes search "onboarding" -t memo               # Filter by type
minutes actions                                   # Open action items across all meetings
minutes actions --assignee sarah                   # Filter by person
minutes list                                      # Recent recordings
```

### Cross-meeting intelligence
```bash
minutes research "pricing strategy"               # Search across all meetings
minutes person "Alex"                              # Build a profile from meeting history
minutes consistency                                # Flag contradicting decisions + stale commitments
```

### Dictation mode
```bash
minutes dictate                                  # Speak → text appears as you talk
minutes dictate --stdout                         # Output to stdout instead of clipboard
```
Text streams progressively as you speak (partial results every 2 seconds). Goes to clipboard + daily note. Local whisper, no cloud.

### System diagnostics
```bash
minutes health                                   # Check model, mic, calendar, disk
minutes demo                                     # Run a demo recording (no mic needed)
```

## Switching from Granola?

Import your meeting history in one command:

```bash
minutes import granola --dry-run    # Preview what will be imported
minutes import granola              # Import all meetings to ~/meetings/
```

Reads from `~/.granola-archivist/output/`. Meetings are converted to Minutes' markdown format with YAML frontmatter. Duplicates are skipped automatically. All your data stays local — no cloud, no $18/mo.

## Output format

Meetings save as markdown with structured YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Q2 Pricing Discussion with Alex
type: meeting
date: 2026-03-17T14:00:00
duration: 42m
context: "Discuss Q2 pricing, follow up on annual billing decision"
action_items:
  - assignee: mat
    task: Send pricing doc
    due: Friday
    status: open
  - assignee: sarah
    task: Review competitor grid
    due: March 21
    status: open
decisions:
  - text: Run pricing experiment at monthly billing with 10 advisors
    topic: pricing experiment
---

## Summary
- Alex proposed lowering API launch timeline from annual billing to monthly billing/mo
- Compromise: run experiment with 10 advisors at monthly billing

## Transcript
[SPEAKER_0 0:00] So let's talk about the pricing...
[SPEAKER_1 4:20] I think monthly billing makes more sense...
```

Works with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), grep, or any markdown tool. Action items and decisions are queryable via the CLI and MCP tools.

## Phone → desktop voice memo pipeline

No phone app needed. Record a thought on your phone, and it becomes searchable memory on your desktop. Claude even surfaces recent memos proactively — "you had a voice memo about pricing yesterday."

The watcher is folder-agnostic — it processes any audio file that lands in a watched folder. Pick the sync method that matches your setup:

| Phone | Desktop | Sync method |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **iPhone** | **Mac** | iCloud Drive (built-in, ~5-30s) |
| **iPhone** | **Windows/Linux** | iCloud for Windows, or Dropbox/Google Drive |
| **Android** | **Any** | Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, or any folder sync |
| **Any** | **Any** | AirDrop, USB, email — drop the file in the watched folder |

### Setup (one-time)

**Step 1: Create a sync folder** — pick one that syncs between your phone and desktop:

```bash
# macOS + iPhone (iCloud Drive)
mkdir -p ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/minutes-inbox

# Any platform (Dropbox)
mkdir -p ~/Dropbox/minutes-inbox

# Any platform (Google Drive)
mkdir -p ~/Google\ Drive/minutes-inbox

# Or just use the default inbox (manually drop files into it)
# ~/.minutes/inbox/  ← already exists
```

**Step 2: Add the sync folder to your watch config** in `~/.config/minutes/config.toml`:

```toml
[watch]
paths = [
  "~/.minutes/inbox",
  # Add your sync folder here — uncomment one:
  # "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/minutes-inbox",  # iCloud
  # "~/Dropbox/minutes-inbox",                                       # Dropbox
  # "~/Google Drive/minutes-inbox",                                  # Google Drive
]
```

**Step 3: Set up your phone**

<details>
<summary><strong>iPhone (Apple Shortcuts)</strong></summary>

1. Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iPhone
2. Tap **+** → Add Action → search **"Save File"**
3. Set destination to `iCloud Drive/minutes-inbox/` (or your Dropbox/Google Drive folder)
4. Turn OFF "Ask Where to Save"
5. Tap the **(i)** info button → enable **Share Sheet** → set to accept **Audio**
6. Name it **"Save to Minutes"**

Now: Voice Memos → Share → **Save to Minutes** → done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Android</strong></summary>

Use any voice recorder app + your cloud sync of choice:

- **Dropbox**: Record with any app → Share → Save to Dropbox → `minutes-inbox/`
- **Google Drive**: Record → Share → Save to Drive → `minutes-inbox/`
- **Syncthing** (no cloud): Set up a Syncthing share between phone and desktop pointing at your watched folder. Fully local, no cloud.
- **Tasker/Automate** (power users): Auto-move new recordings from your recorder app to the sync folder.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual (any phone)</strong></summary>

No sync setup needed — just get the audio file to your desktop's watched folder:
- **AirDrop** (Apple): Share → AirDrop to Mac → move to `~/.minutes/inbox/`
- **Email**: Email the recording to yourself → save attachment to watched folder
- **USB**: Transfer directly
</details>

**Step 4: Start the watcher** (or install as a background service):

```bash
minutes watch                  # Run in foreground
minutes service install        # Or install as background service (auto-starts on login, macOS)
```

### How it works

```
Phone (any)                   Desktop (any)
───────────                   ─────────────
Record voice memo        →    Cloud sync / manual transfer
Share to sync folder               │
                                   ▼
                            minutes watch detects file
                                   │
                            probe duration (<2 min?)
                              ├── yes → memo pipeline (fast, no diarization)
                              └── no  → meeting pipeline (full)
                                   │
                            transcribe → save markdown
                                   │
                            ├── event: VoiceMemoProcessed
                            ├── daily note backlink
                            └── surfaces in next Claude session
```

Short voice memos (<2 minutes) automatically route through the fast memo pipeline — no diarization, no heavy summarization. Long recordings get the full meeting treatment. The threshold is configurable: `dictation_threshold_secs = 120` in `[watch]`.

### Optional: sidecar metadata

If your phone workflow also saves a `.json` file alongside the audio (same name, `.json` extension), Minutes reads it for enriched metadata:

```json
{"device": "iPhone", "source": "voice-memos", "captured_at": "2026-03-24T08:41:00-07:00"}
```

This adds `device` and `captured_at` to the meeting's frontmatter. Works with any automation tool (Apple Shortcuts, Tasker, etc.).

Supports `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.webm`. Format conversion is automatic via [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia).

### Vault sync (Obsidian / Logseq)

```bash
minutes vault setup              # Auto-detect vaults, configure sync
minutes vault status             # Check health
minutes vault sync               # Copy existing meetings to vault
```

Three strategies: **symlink** (zero-copy), **copy** (works with iCloud/Obsidian Sync), **direct** (write to vault). `minutes vault setup` detects your vault and recommends the right strategy automatically.

## Claude integration

minutes is a native extension for the Claude ecosystem. **No API keys needed** — Claude summarizes your meetings when you ask, using your existing Claude subscription.

```
You: "Summarize my last meeting"
Claude: [calls get_meeting] → reads transcript → summarizes in conversation

You: "What did Alex say about pricing?"
Claude: [calls search_meetings] → finds matches → synthesizes answer

You: "Any open action items for me?"
Claude: [calls list_meetings] → scans frontmatter → reports open items
```

### Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, your own agent)

Minutes exposes a standard MCP server. Point any MCP-compatible client at it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minutes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["minutes-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**13 tools:** `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `get_status`, `list_meetings`, `search_meetings`, `get_meeting`, `process_audio`, `add_note`, `consistency_report`, `get_person_profile`, `research_topic`, `qmd_collection_status`, `register_qmd_collection`

**6 resources:** `minutes://meetings/recent`, `minutes://status`, `minutes://actions/open`, `minutes://events/recent`, `minutes://meetings/{slug}`, `ui://minutes/dashboard`

**Interactive dashboard (Claude Desktop):** 5 tools render an inline interactive UI via [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/apps) — meeting list with filter/search, detail view with fullscreen + "Send to Claude" context injection, person profiles, consistency reports. Text-only clients see the same data as plain text.

### Claude Code (Plugin)

Install the plugin from the marketplace:
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add silverstein/minutes
claude plugin install minutes
```

12 skills, 1 agent, 2 hooks:
```
├── Core: /minutes record, search, list, note, ideas, verify, setup, cleanup
├── Interactive: /minutes prep, debrief, recap, weekly
├── Agent: meeting-analyst (cross-meeting intelligence)
└── Hooks: post-recording alerts + proactive meeting/voice memo reminders
```

**Meeting lifecycle skills** — inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)'s interactive skill pattern:

```
/minutes prep "call with Alex"     → relationship brief, talking points, .prep.md saved
  ↓
minutes record → minutes stop       → hook alerts if decisions conflict with prior meetings
  ↓
/minutes debrief                    → "You wanted to resolve pricing. Did you?"
  ↓
/minutes weekly                     → themes, decision arcs, stale items, Monday brief
```

### Minutes Desktop Assistant

The Tauri menu bar app includes a built-in AI Assistant window backed by the
same local meeting artifacts. It runs as a singleton assistant session:

- `AI Assistant` opens or focuses the persistent assistant window
- `Discuss with AI` reuses that same assistant and switches its active meeting focus

### Cowork / Dispatch
MCP tools are automatically available in Cowork. From your phone via Dispatch: *"Start recording"* → Mac captures → Claude processes → summary on your phone.

### Optional: automated summarization

```toml
# Use your existing Claude Code or Codex subscription (recommended)
[summarization]
engine = "agent"
agent_command = "claude"  # or "codex" for OpenAI Codex users

# Or use a free local LLM
[summarization]
engine = "ollama"
ollama_model = "llama3.2"
```

## Install

### macOS

```bash
# Desktop app (menu bar, recording UI, AI assistant)
brew install --cask silverstein/tap/minutes

# CLI only (terminal recording, search, vault sync)
brew tap silverstein/tap
brew install minutes

# Or from source (requires Rust + cmake)
export CXXFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/c++/v1"
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Download pre-built binary from GitHub releases, or build from source:
# Requires: Rust, cmake, MSVC build tools
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

### Linux

```bash
# Requires: Rust, cmake, ALSA dev headers
sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

### GPU acceleration (optional)

Build with GPU support for significantly faster transcription:

```bash
# NVIDIA GPU (Windows/Linux — requires CUDA toolkit)
cargo install --path crates/cli --features cuda

# Apple Metal (macOS)
cargo install --path crates/cli --features metal

# Apple CoreML (macOS Neural Engine)
cargo install --path crates/cli --features coreml
```

> **Windows CUDA users:** You may need to set environment variables before building:
> ```powershell
> $env:CUDA_PATH = "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.4"
> $env:CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER = "$env:CUDA_PATH\bin\nvcc.exe"
> $env:LIBCLANG_PATH = "C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"
> $env:CMAKE_GENERATOR = "NMake Makefiles"
> ```
> The first CUDA build takes longer than usual (compiling GPU kernels) — this is a one-time cost.

### Setup (all platforms)

```bash
# Download whisper model
minutes setup --model tiny    # Quick start (75MB, fast, less accurate)
minutes setup --model small   # Recommended (466MB, good accuracy)
minutes setup --model base    # Middle ground (141MB)
```

> **Platform notes:** Calendar integration (auto-detecting meeting attendees) requires macOS. Screen context capture works on macOS and Linux. The voice memo pipeline works on all platforms — any folder sync (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing) can feed the watcher. The `minutes service install` auto-start command requires macOS (launchd); on Linux, use systemd or cron. All other features — recording, transcription, search, action items, person profiles — work on all platforms.

### Desktop app

```bash
# macOS — Homebrew cask (recommended)
brew install --cask silverstein/tap/minutes

# macOS — build from source
export CXXFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/c++/v1"
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
cargo tauri build --bundles app

# macOS — local desktop development with stable permissions
./scripts/install-dev-app.sh
```

```powershell
# Windows — build desktop binary from source
cargo install tauri-cli --version 2.10.1 --locked
cd tauri/src-tauri
cargo tauri build --ci --no-bundle
```

Tagged GitHub releases can also include a Windows desktop binary as `minutes-desktop-windows-x64.exe`.

The desktop app adds a system tray icon, recording controls, audio visualizer, Recall, and a meeting list window. The current Windows desktop build covers recording, transcription, search, settings, and Recall. Calendar suggestions, call detection, tray copy/paste automation, and the native dictation hotkey remain macOS-only for now.

For macOS development, use a dedicated signed dev app identity:

- Production app: `/Applications/Minutes.app` (`com.useminutes.desktop`)
- Development app: `~/Applications/Minutes Dev.app` (`com.useminutes.desktop.dev`)

If you are testing hotkeys, Screen Recording, Input Monitoring, or repeated macOS permission prompts, launch only `Minutes Dev.app` via `./scripts/install-dev-app.sh`. Avoid the repo symlink `./Minutes.app`, raw `target/` binaries, or ad-hoc local bundles for TCC-sensitive testing.

This repository is open source, so local development does not require the
maintainer's Apple signing credentials:

- `./scripts/install-dev-app.sh` works with ad-hoc signing by default
- for more stable macOS permission behavior across rebuilds, set
  `MINUTES_DEV_SIGNING_IDENTITY` to a consistent local codesigning identity
- release signing and notarization remain maintainer/release workflows

**Privacy:** All Minutes windows are hidden from screen sharing by default — other participants on Zoom/Meet/Teams won't see the app. Toggle via the tray menu: "Hide from Screen Share ✓".

### Troubleshooting

**No speech detected / blank audio:**
The most common cause is microphone permissions. Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone and ensure your terminal app (or Minutes.app) has access.

**tmux users:** tmux server runs as a separate process that doesn't inherit your terminal's mic permission. Either run `minutes record` from a direct terminal window (not inside tmux), or use the Minutes.app desktop bundle which gets its own mic permission.

**Build fails with C++ errors on macOS 26+:**
whisper.cpp needs the SDK include path. Set `CXXFLAGS` as shown above before building.

**Dictation hotkey still fails after you enabled it in System Settings:**
The native hotkey uses macOS Input Monitoring, which is separate from Screen Recording. The fastest way to test the exact installed desktop identity is:

```bash
./scripts/diagnose-desktop-hotkey.sh "$HOME/Applications/Minutes Dev.app"
```

Use `./scripts/install-dev-app.sh` first so you are testing the stable development app identity rather than a raw `target/` build. The helper intentionally launches the app through LaunchServices; direct shell execution of `Contents/MacOS/minutes-app --diagnose-hotkey` can misreport TCC status.

## Configuration

Optional — minutes works out of the box.

```toml
# ~/.config/minutes/config.toml

[transcription]
model = "small"           # tiny (75MB), base, small (466MB), medium, large-v3 (3.1GB)

[summarization]
engine = "none"           # Default: Claude summarizes conversationally via MCP
                          # "agent" = uses your Claude Code or Codex subscription (no API key)
                          # "ollama" = local, free
                          # "claude" / "openai" = direct API key (legacy)
agent_command = "claude"  # Which CLI to use when engine = "agent" (claude, codex, etc.)
ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"
ollama_model = "llama3.2"

[diarization]
engine = "none"           # "none" (default) or "pyannote" (requires pip install pyannote.audio + HuggingFace auth)

[search]
engine = "builtin"        # builtin (regex) or qmd (semantic)

[watch]
paths = ["~/.minutes/inbox"]
settle_delay_ms = 2000              # Cloud sync safety delay (wait for file to finish syncing)
dictation_threshold_secs = 120      # Files shorter than this → memo (skip diarize). 0 = disable.
# Add cloud sync folders to watch for phone voice memos:
# paths = ["~/.minutes/inbox", "~/Dropbox/minutes-inbox"]

[screen_context]
enabled = false           # Opt-in: capture screenshots during recording for LLM context
interval_secs = 30        # How often to capture (seconds)
keep_after_summary = false # Delete screenshots after summarization (default: clean up)

[assistant]
agent = "claude"          # CLI launched by the Tauri AI Assistant
agent_args = []           # Optional extra args, e.g. ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
```

Single `minutes-core` library shared by CLI, MCP server, and Tauri app. Zero code duplication.

### Building your own agent on Minutes

Minutes is designed as infrastructure for AI agents. The MCP server is the primary integration surface:

- **Read meetings**: `list_meetings`, `search_meetings`, `get_meeting` return structured JSON
- **Track people**: `get_person_profile` builds cross-meeting profiles with topics, open commitments
- **Monitor consistency**: `consistency_report` flags conflicting decisions and stale commitments
- **Record + process**: `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `process_audio` for pipeline control
- **Resources**: Stable URIs (`minutes://meetings/recent`, `minutes://actions/open`) for agent context injection

Any agent framework that speaks MCP can use Minutes as its conversation memory layer — the agent handles the intelligence, Minutes handles the recall.

**Built with:** Rust, [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia), [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal), [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), [ureq](https://github.com/algesten/ureq)
