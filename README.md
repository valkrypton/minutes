# minutes

**Your AI remembers every conversation you've had.**

Agents have run logs. Humans have conversations. **minutes** captures the human side — the decisions, the intent, the context that agents need but can't observe — and makes it queryable.

Record a meeting. Capture a voice memo on a walk. Ask Claude what was decided three weeks ago. It just works.

```
$ minutes record --context "Q2 pricing discussion with Alex"
Recording... (Ctrl-C or `minutes stop` to finish)
  Tip: add notes with `minutes note "your note"` in another terminal

  [4:20] I think monthly billing makes more sense for independent advisors...
```

```
$ minutes actions --assignee mat

```

## How it works

```
Audio → Transcribe → Diarize → Summarize → Structured Markdown
         (local)     (speakers)   (LLM)       (decisions,
        whisper.cpp   pyannote   Claude/       action items,
                                 Ollama/       searchable)
                                 OpenAI
```

Everything runs locally. Your audio never leaves your machine (unless you opt into cloud LLM summarization).

## Install

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew tap silverstein/tap
brew install minutes

# From source (requires Rust + cmake)
# macOS 15+ / Xcode 26+: set C++ include path for whisper.cpp
export CXXFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/c++/v1"
cargo install --path crates/cli

# Download whisper model
minutes setup --model tiny    # Quick start (75MB, fast, less accurate)
minutes setup --model small   # Recommended (466MB, good accuracy)
minutes setup --model base    # Middle ground (141MB)
```

### Desktop app (optional)

```bash
export CXXFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/c++/v1"
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
cargo tauri build --bundles app
# Opens: target/release/bundle/macos/Minutes.app
```

The desktop app adds a system tray icon, recording controls, audio visualizer, and a meeting list window. macOS will prompt for microphone permission on first recording.

**Privacy:** All Minutes windows are hidden from screen sharing by default — other participants on Zoom/Meet/Teams won't see the app. Toggle via the tray menu: "Hide from Screen Share ✓".

### Signed macOS releases

Maintainers can build signed and notarized desktop releases with the GitHub
Actions workflow in
[.github/workflows/release-macos.yml](/Users/silverbook/Sites/minutes/.github/workflows/release-macos.yml).

The full secrets contract and maintainer steps live in
[docs/RELEASE-MACOS.md](/Users/silverbook/Sites/minutes/docs/RELEASE-MACOS.md).

Stable vs preview channels and rollback expectations live in
[docs/RELEASE-CHANNELS.md](/Users/silverbook/Sites/minutes/docs/RELEASE-CHANNELS.md).
Reproducible release-note generation lives in
[docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md](/Users/silverbook/Sites/minutes/docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md).
The current auto-update evaluation and recommendation live in
[docs/AUTO-UPDATE-EVALUATION.md](/Users/silverbook/Sites/minutes/docs/AUTO-UPDATE-EVALUATION.md).

### Troubleshooting

**No speech detected / blank audio:**
The most common cause is microphone permissions. Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone and ensure your terminal app (or Minutes.app) has access.

**tmux users:** tmux server runs as a separate process that doesn't inherit your terminal's mic permission. Either run `minutes record` from a direct terminal window (not inside tmux), or use the Minutes.app desktop bundle which gets its own mic permission.

**Build fails with C++ errors on macOS 26+:**
whisper.cpp needs the SDK include path. Set `CXXFLAGS` as shown above before building.

## Features

### Record meetings
```bash
minutes record                                    # Record from mic
minutes record --title "Standup" --context "Sprint 4 blockers"  # With context
minutes stop                                      # Stop from another terminal
```

### Take notes during meetings
```bash
minutes note "Alex wants monthly billing not annual billing"          # Timestamped, feeds into summary
minutes note "Logan agreed"                       # LLM weights your notes heavily
```

### Process voice memos
```bash
minutes process ~/Downloads/voice-memo.m4a        # Any audio format
minutes watch                                     # Auto-process new files in inbox
```

### Search everything
```bash
minutes search "pricing"                          # Full-text search
minutes search "onboarding" -t memo               # Filter by type
minutes actions                                   # Open action items across all meetings
minutes actions --assignee sarah                   # Filter by person
minutes list                                      # Recent recordings
```

### Post-meeting annotations
```bash
minutes note --meeting ~/meetings/2026-03-17-pricing.md "Alex confirmed via email"
```

### Screen context (opt-in)

Capture periodic screenshots during recording so the LLM knows what was on screen when someone said "look at this number." Screenshots are sent as images to vision-capable LLMs (Claude, GPT-4o).

```toml
# ~/.config/minutes/config.toml
[screen_context]
enabled = true
interval_secs = 30
```

Privacy: disabled by default, screenshots are 0600 permissions, auto-deleted after summarization, downscaled to 1280px. Requires Screen Recording permission on macOS.

## Output format

Meetings save as markdown with structured YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Q2 Pricing Discussion with Alex
type: meeting
date: 2026-03-17T14:00:00
duration: 42m
context: "Discuss Q2 pricing, follow up on annual billing decision"
action_items:
  - assignee: mat
    task: Send pricing doc
    due: Friday
    status: open
  - assignee: sarah
    task: Review competitor grid
    due: March 21
    status: open
decisions:
  - text: Run pricing experiment at monthly billing with 10 advisors
    topic: pricing experiment
---

## Summary
- Alex proposed lowering API launch timeline from annual billing to monthly billing/mo
- Compromise: run experiment with 10 advisors at monthly billing

## Notes
- [4:23] Alex wants monthly billing not annual billing
- [12:10] Logan agreed

## Decisions
- [x] Run pricing experiment at monthly billing with 10 advisors

## Action Items
- [ ] @user: Send pricing doc by Friday
- [ ] @sarah: Review competitor grid by March 21

## Transcript
[SPEAKER_0 0:00] So let's talk about the pricing...
[SPEAKER_1 4:20] I think monthly billing makes more sense...
```

Works with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), grep, or any markdown tool. Action items and decisions are queryable via the CLI and MCP tools.

## Claude integration

minutes is a native extension for the Claude ecosystem. **No API keys needed** — Claude summarizes your meetings when you ask, using your existing Claude subscription.

The pipeline captures and transcribes locally. Claude does the intelligence:

```
You: "Summarize my last meeting"
Claude: [calls get_meeting] → reads transcript → summarizes in conversation

You: "What did Alex say about pricing?"
Claude: [calls search_meetings] → finds matches → synthesizes answer

You: "Any open action items for me?"
Claude: [calls list_meetings] → scans frontmatter → reports open items
```

No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. No extra cost. Just your Claude subscription doing what it already does — but with your meeting history as context.

### Claude Desktop (MCP)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minutes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/minutes/crates/mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

8 MCP tools: `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `get_status`, `list_meetings`, `search_meetings`, `get_meeting`, `process_audio`, `add_note`

### Claude Code (Plugin)
```
.claude/plugins/minutes/
├── 11 skills:
│   ├── Core: /minutes record, search, list, note, verify, setup, cleanup
│   └── Interactive: /minutes prep, debrief, recap, weekly
├── 1 agent: meeting-analyst (cross-meeting intelligence)
└── 2 hooks: post-recording alerts + proactive meeting reminders
```

**Meeting lifecycle skills** — inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)'s interactive skill pattern:

```
/minutes prep "call with Alex"     → relationship brief, talking points, .prep.md saved
  ↓
minutes record → minutes stop       → hook alerts if decisions conflict with prior meetings
  ↓
/minutes debrief                    → "You wanted to resolve pricing. Did you?"
  ↓
/minutes weekly                     → themes, decision arcs, stale items, Monday brief
```

Each interactive skill pushes back on vague input, produces actionable intelligence, and ends with a three-beat closing ritual (signal reflection, concrete assignment, next-skill nudge).

### Minutes Desktop Assistant

The Tauri menu bar app includes a built-in AI Assistant window backed by the
same local meeting artifacts. It runs as a singleton assistant session:

- `AI Assistant` opens or focuses the persistent assistant window
- `Discuss with AI` reuses that same assistant and switches its active meeting focus
- General assistant instructions live in `CLAUDE.md`; meeting-specific focus is written to `CURRENT_MEETING.md`

### Cowork / Dispatch
MCP tools are automatically available in Cowork. From your phone via Dispatch: *"Start recording"* → Mac captures → Claude processes → summary on your phone.

### Optional: automated summarization

If you want summaries generated automatically in the pipeline (without asking Claude each time), you can configure a local LLM:

```toml
[summarization]
engine = "ollama"         # Free, local, no API key
ollama_model = "llama3.2"
```

Or use API keys for cloud LLMs — but most users won't need this since Claude handles it conversationally.

## Voice memos (iPhone → Mac)

No iOS app needed. Use Apple's built-in Voice Memos + a Shortcut:

1. Run `minutes watch` on your Mac (or install the launchd service for auto-start)
2. Record in Voice Memos on iPhone
3. Share → "Save to Minutes" (iCloud Drive sync)
4. Markdown appears in `~/meetings/memos/`

Supports `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.webm`. Format conversion is automatic via [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia).

## Configuration

Optional — minutes works out of the box.

```toml
# ~/.config/minutes/config.toml

[transcription]
model = "small"           # tiny (75MB), base, small (466MB), medium, large-v3 (3.1GB)

[summarization]
engine = "none"           # Default: Claude summarizes conversationally via MCP
                          # "agent" = uses your Claude Code or Codex subscription (no API key)
                          # "ollama" = local, free
                          # "claude" / "openai" = direct API key (legacy)
agent_command = "claude"  # Which CLI to use when engine = "agent" (claude, codex, etc.)
ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"
ollama_model = "llama3.2"

[diarization]
engine = "pyannote"       # pyannote (best quality) or none

[search]
engine = "builtin"        # builtin (regex) or qmd (semantic)

[watch]
paths = ["~/.minutes/inbox"]
settle_delay_ms = 2000    # iCloud sync safety delay

[screen_context]
enabled = false           # Opt-in: capture screenshots during recording for LLM context
interval_secs = 30        # How often to capture (seconds)
keep_after_summary = false # Delete screenshots after summarization (default: clean up)

[assistant]
agent = "claude"          # CLI launched by the Tauri AI Assistant
agent_args = []           # Optional extra args, e.g. ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
```

## Architecture

```
